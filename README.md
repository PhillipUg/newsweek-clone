In this project, my aim was to make a clone of the [Newsweek](https://newsweek.com/) website.

There are some elements on this page which are produced with Javascript but my objective in this project wasn't to give this page functionality.

## Built with
  * [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * HTML
  * SASS
